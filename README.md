## Usage
* To use our application, a user needs to create an account when they first open the website.
* Then, a user can view and read all of the posts created by users on the map and in the side panel. 
* If a user wants to create a post, they can go to the incorporate post page to create one. 
* Then they can check their profile to view how many posts they have read, the posts they have created, and other info. 
* If the user wants to re-read or view the posts they have read, they can go to the post history page.
* A user can also check the aboutus page to understand more about this application.

## Known Bugs and Limitations
Here are some known bugs:
* The main.html page has a fluidity issue. The size of the screen can change in height whenever a user zooms in our out. 
* The Navigation Bar has a sizing issue; Right before the switch to mobile view the navigation bar becomes compressed/squished.
* The application does not let you know that the image of the post is uploading whenever a post is created. This means that users may become confused and hit the submit button button multiple times. If they do this the post will be uploaded multiple times, and the post will not register that it was from the user.
* The top posts currently shows all of the posts.
* A grey bar appears next to the side panel on desktop view when you first go onto the main page.
* On the mobile view, the side panel covers half the screen when the main page is first opened.
* On mobile view, whenever the side panel button is clicked, it stays in its clicked color (black).
* There is a footer issue on the profile page, where a normal bootstrap footer stays in the middle of the page when there are no posts, and sticky footer covers posts when there are more than one. 

## Features for Future
What we'd like to build in the future:
* We want to complete the search bar and filter functionality. We think this would allow for greater user experience and efficiency.
* We want to include a comments section for each post so that users can discuss about the topic. 
* We want to allow users to visit other profiles and search for other profiles.
